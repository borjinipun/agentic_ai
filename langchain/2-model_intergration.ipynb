       "'Parrots talk primarily due to a unique combination of their **vocal anatomy, advanced cognitive abilities, and strong social instincts.**\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of the key reasons:\\n\\n1.  **Unique Vocal Anatomy (The Syrinx):**\\n    *   Unlike humans who have vocal cords in their larynx, parrots (and other birds) have a specialized vocal organ called the **syrinx** located at the base of their trachea.\\n    *   The syrinx is highly complex and allows parrots to produce an incredibly wide range of sounds, including mimicking the pitch, tone, and inflection of human speech with remarkable accuracy. They can control different parts of the syrinx independently, giving them great flexibility.\\n\\n2.  **Advanced Cognitive Abilities and Brain Structure:**\\n    *   Parrots are among the most intelligent birds. They have complex brain structures, particularly developed \"vocal learning centers,\" which are crucial for their ability to imitate sounds.\\n    *   These brain regions allow them to process and remember a vast array of sounds and then attempt to reproduce them. Species like the African Grey Parrot are especially known for their cognitive abilities, often associating words with their meanings.\\n\\n3.  **Strong Social Instincts and Mimicry as a Social Tool:**\\n    *   Parrots are highly social animals that live in flocks in the wild. Communication is vital for flock cohesion, warning of danger, identifying individuals, and strengthening social bonds.\\n    *   When a parrot lives with humans, it often perceives its human caregivers as its \"flock.\" Mimicking human speech or other sounds in their environment becomes a way for them to:\\n        *   **Fit in and bond:** By making sounds similar to their flock (you!), they feel more connected.\\n        *   **Get attention:** They quickly learn that producing certain sounds or words elicits a reaction from their human companions, often in the form of praise, treats, or interaction. This positive reinforcement encourages them to talk more.\\n        *   **Communicate needs:** Over time, some parrots learn to associate words with objects or actions (e.g., saying \"cracker\" to ask for a treat, or \"hello\" when someone enters the room).\\n\\n4.  **Learning and Reinforcement:**\\n    *   Parrots are excellent learners. They pick up on patterns and associations. If they say a word and get a desired response, they are more likely to repeat it. This is a form of operant conditioning. They don\\'t necessarily understand the *grammar* of human language, but they can understand the *context* and *outcome* of certain vocalizations.\\n\\n**In summary:** Parrots talk because they have the physical ability (syrinx), the brainpower (vocal learning centers), and a strong social drive to connect with their \"flock\" and interact with their environment. While they can use words contextually, it\\'s generally considered mimicry and association rather than a true understanding of language in the human sense.'"

But why do they do that? Is it just a learned behavior, or is there a deeper reason?\\n\\nI think I read somewhere that parrots have a vocal organ called the syrinx, which allows them to produce a wide range of sounds. Humans have vocal cords, but the syrinx might be different. So maybe their anatomy enables them to mimic sounds more easily than other birds. But why would they evolve that ability?\\n\\nI also recall that in the wild, parrots live in social groups. Maybe talking is a way for them to communicate with each other. If they can mimic sounds, they can learn to recognize each other\\'s calls or signals. But in captivity, they mimic humans. So maybe it\\'s a form of social interaction. If a parrot is with humans, it might mimic their sounds to interact with them, similar to how they would with other parrots.\\n\\nAnother thought: some birds, like parrots, learn to mimic as part of their development. For example, young parrots learn to talk by listening to their parents. If they\\'re raised by humans, they might pick up human words instead. So maybe it\\'s a learned behavior through imitation, much like how humans learn to speak by listening to others.\\n\\nAlso, there\\'s something about the brain structure.

I think research suggests that some parrots have comprehension of the words they use. For example, Alex the African Grey Parrot could identify colors, shapes, and quantities. So there\\'s a cognitive aspect to their mimicry, not just mechanical repetition.\\n\\nPutting this all together, the reasons parrots talk include their anatomical ability to mimic sounds, social learning from their environment (both wild and captive), the structure of their brain that supports vocal learning, and the use of mimicry as a tool for communication and interaction with others.

      "2.  **Camouflage (Counter-intuitive but True!):** While a bright red macaw might seem to stand out in a zoo, imagine it in its natural habitat:\n",
      "|    *   **Tropical Forests:** Their homes are incredibly colorful, with bright flowers, fruits, lush green foliage, and dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy. The reds, blues, greens, and yellows can actually help break up a parrot's outline| against this visually \"noisy\" background.\n",
      "    *   **Disruptive Coloration:** Rather than blending in perfectly with one color, their varied patterns and colors can make it difficult for predators (like hawks or eagles) to distinguish the| bird's shape among the complex patterns of leaves and light.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Species Recognition:** In areas where multiple parrot species live side-by-side, specific patterns and color combinations help parrots quickly identify members of their own species|. This is crucial for:\n",

      "4.  **Signaling Health and| Diet:**\n",
      "    *   **Pigment Sourcing:** Many of the red, orange, and yellow colors in parrot feathers come from pigments called carotenoids, which they obtain through their diet (fruits, vegetables, seeds). A parrot with access to a| rich diet will have more vibrant colors, directly indicating its foraging prowess and overall health.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Social Communication:** Within their highly social flocks, colors might play a role in communication, though this is less studied than mate attraction.| It could contribute to displays of status, excitement, or general flock cohesion.\n",

Females (or sometimes males, depending on the species) will choose mates with the most impressive plumage, as it suggests they are better providers and will produce stronger offspring.\\n    *   **Species Recognition:** In areas where multiple parrot species live together, distinct color patterns help individuals identify and choose mates of their own species, preventing hybridization.\\n\\n2.  **Camouflage (Counter-intuitive but True):** While they seem incredibly bright to us, their colors can actually provide effective camouflage in their natural habitats.\\n    *   **Blending with the Environment:** Many parrots live in lush, vibrant environments like rainforests, filled with green leaves, colorful flowers, and ripe fruits. A bright green parrot can disappear in the canopy, and even reds and yellows can blend with flowers or dappled sunlight through dense foliage.\\n    *   **Disruptive Coloration:** Bold patterns and contrasting colors can break up the outline of a bird\\'s body, making it harder for predators to distinguish them against a complex background.\\n\\n3.  **Signaling Dominance and Status:** Within a flock, more vibrant colors can signal a bird\\'s health, age, or dominance, influencing social hierarchies.\\n\\n4.  **Diet and Pigments:** The colors come from two main sources:\\n    *   **Pigments from Diet (Carotenoids):** Many yellow, orange, and red colors come from pigments called carotenoids, which parrots obtain from the fruits, seeds, and vegetation they eat. A bird\\'s ability to forage for a diet rich in these pigments directly translates to brighter colors, reinforcing the \"health signal.\"\\n    *   **Unique Parrot Pigments (Psittacofulvins):** Parrots also possess a unique class of pigments called psittacofulvins, which they synthesize themselves. These are responsible for many of their brilliant red, orange, and yellow hues. The ability to synthesize these costly pigments is another strong indicator of a bird\\'s metabolic health and fitness.\\n    *   **Structural Colors:** Blues, purples, and some greens in parrots are not due to pigments, but to the microscopic structure of their feathers. These structures scatter light in specific ways, creating iridescent and vibrant hues that change with the viewing angle.\\n\\n5.  **UV Vision:** Importantly, parrots (and most birds) can see in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which humans cannot. This means their feathers look even more complex and vibrant to each other than they do to us. Many parrots that appear \"plain\" to the human eye actually have striking UV patterns that are crucial for communication and mate selection within their own species.\\n\\nIn essence, a parrot\\'s colorful plumage is a complex advertisement, a hidden uniform, and a functional tool, all rolled into one beautiful package.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'} id='lc_run--019b507c-c684-72a3-8a0b-054579afed42-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 8, 'output_tokens': 1734, 'total_tokens': 1742, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1088}}\n",

When these forces are precisely controlled, an aircraft can take off, fly, and land.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of how it works:\\n\\n1.  **Lift (Upward Force):**\\n    *   **How it\\'s generated:** The most crucial element for flight is the wing. Wings are designed with a special shape called an **airfoil** – typically curved on top and flatter on the bottom.\\n    *   **Aerodynamics:** As the airplane moves forward, air flows over and under the wing.\\n        *   **Bernoulli\\'s Principle:** The curved upper surface forces the air to travel a longer distance in the same amount of time, making it speed up. Faster-moving air has lower pressure. The air underneath travels a shorter distance, moves slower, and has higher pressure. This pressure difference creates an upward force, pushing the wing up.\\n        *   **Newton\\'s Third Law:** The wing is also angled slightly upwards (called the \"angle of attack\"). As the wing pushes air downwards, according to Newton\\'s Third Law (\"for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction\"), the air pushes the wing upwards.\\n    *   **Factors influencing lift:** Airspeed, wing shape, wing size, angle of attack, and air density.\\n\\n2.  **Weight (Downward Force):**\\n    *   **What it is:** This is the force of gravity pulling the airplane downwards. It includes the weight of the aircraft structure, fuel, passengers, and cargo.\\n    *   **To fly:** For an airplane to take off and climb, the lift generated must be greater than its weight. For level flight, lift must equal weight.\\n\\n3.  **Thrust (Forward Force):**\\n    *   **How it\\'s generated:** Engines (jet engines or propellers) provide thrust.\\n        *   **Jet Engines:** Suck in air, compress it, mix it with fuel, ignite it, and expel a high-velocity stream of hot gas out the back. This powerful expulsion of gas creates a forward push (Newton\\'s Third Law).\\n        *   **Propellers:** Act like rotating wings, \"screwing\" through the air and pulling the aircraft forward. They push air backward to generate forward thrust.\\n    *   **To fly:** Thrust must be greater than drag for the aircraft to accelerate and gain speed. For constant speed in level flight, thrust must equal drag.\\n\\n4.  **Drag (Backward Force):**\\n    *   **What it is:** This is the resistance the airplane encounters as it moves through the air. It\\'s similar to the resistance you feel when you put your hand out of a car window.\\n    *   **Types:**\\n        *   **Parasite drag:** Caused by the aircraft\\'s shape (friction, air hitting surfaces).\\n        *   **Induced drag:** Created as a byproduct of generating lift.\\n    *   **Minimizing drag:** Airplanes are designed to be as aerodynamic and streamlined as possible to reduce drag, allowing them to fly more efficiently.\\n\\n**In summary, here\\'s the sequence for flight:**\\n\\n1.  **Takeoff:** The engines generate maximum **thrust**, accelerating the plane down the runway. As speed increases, the wings generate more and more **lift**. When **lift** becomes greater than **weight**, the aircraft takes off.\\n2.  **Climb:** **Thrust** continues to be greater than **drag**, and **lift** remains greater than **weight**, allowing the plane to ascend.\\n3.  **Level Flight:** The pilot adjusts engine **thrust** and wing angle to reach a point where **lift** perfectly balances **weight**, and **thrust** perfectly balances **drag**. The plane then flies at a constant altitude and speed.\\n4.  **Descent:** The pilot reduces **thrust**, allowing **drag** to become greater and slow the plane. They might also reduce **lift** (e.g., by lowering the nose), allowing **weight** to overcome **lift**, causing the plane to descend.\\n5.  **Landing:** **Thrust** is significantly reduced, and devices like flaps (which increase lift and drag at lower speeds) and spoilers (which reduce lift and increase drag) are used to slow the plane and bring it gently down to the runway.\\n\\nIt\\'s a marvel of engineering and physics, allowing massive machines to soar through the sky!' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'} id='lc_run--019b507c-c685-72d3-ac89-e6e5ce023549-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6, 'output_tokens': 2095, 'total_tokens': 2101, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1151}}\n",
      "content='Quantum computing is a **new type of computing paradigm** that harnesses the principles of **quantum mechanics** to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers that rely on bits, quantum computers use **qubits**, which behave in fundamentally different ways. This allows them to tackle certain types of complex problems that are practically impossible for even the most powerful classical supercomputers.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of its key aspects:\\n\\n### 1. The Core Difference: Bits vs. Qubits\\n\\n*   **Classical Computers (Bits):** Store information as **bits**, which can be either a **0 or a 1** at any given time. Think of it like a light switch that is either ON or OFF.\\n*   **Quantum Computers (Qubits):** Store information as **qubits**, which leverage quantum phenomena:\\n    *   **Superposition:** A qubit can exist in a **combination of 0 and 1 simultaneously**. Imagine a spinning coin that is both heads and tails until it lands. This means a single qubit can represent much more information than a classical bit. With multiple qubits, the number of states they can represent grows exponentially.\\n    *   **Entanglement:** Two or more qubits can become **linked** in such a way that they share the same fate, even when physically separated. The state of one instantly influences the state of the others. This allows qubits to process information in a highly interconnected and powerful way.\\n    *   **Interference:** Similar to how waves can constructively or destructively interfere, quantum computers can manipulate the probabilities of different outcomes, amplifying correct answers and canceling out incorrect ones.\\n\\n### 2. How Quantum Computing Works (in simple terms)\\n\\nInstead of processing information sequentially like classical computers, quantum computers can explore and process **many possibilities simultaneously** due to superposition and entanglement. They set up a system of qubits, allow them to evolve and interact according to quantum mechanics, and then measure the final state. The trick is to design the quantum algorithm so that the desired answer has a high probability of being the outcome of the measurement.\\n\\n### 3. Why is it Powerful?\\n\\nThis ability to be in multiple states at once and to be entangled means quantum computers can perform calculations that would take classical computers an astronomically long time (billions of years, for example). This parallel processing at a fundamental level unlocks the potential to solve problems previously considered intractable.\\n\\n### 4. What Can Quantum Computing Be Used For? (Potential Applications)\\n\\nWhile still in its early stages, quantum computing holds immense promise for:\\n\\n*   **Drug Discovery & Materials Science:** Simulating molecular interactions and material properties with unprecedented accuracy, leading to new medicines, catalysts, and advanced materials.\\n*   **Cryptography:** Breaking current encryption methods (e.g., RSA) using algorithms like Shor\\'s, and developing new, quantum-safe encryption methods.\\n*   **Optimization:** Solving complex optimization problems in logistics, finance, manufacturing, and transportation (e.g., optimizing supply chains, financial portfolios).\\n*   **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:** Enhancing AI algorithms, speeding up machine learning, and enabling new types of AI.\\n*   **Financial Modeling:** More accurate risk assessment and market prediction.\\n*   **Weather Forecasting & Climate Modeling:** Running more complex and accurate simulations.\\n\\n### 5. Current State and Challenges\\n\\n*   **Nascent Technology:** Quantum computing is still very much in its infancy. Current quantum computers (often called \"NISQ\" - Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) are relatively small (tens to a few hundreds of qubits), prone to errors, and extremely sensitive to environmental interference (temperature, electromagnetic fields).\\n*   **Decoherence:** Qubits lose their quantum properties very easily, which is a major challenge.\\n*   **Error Correction:** Developing robust quantum error correction methods is crucial but very difficult.\\n*   **Scalability:** Building larger, more stable, and error-corrected quantum computers remains a significant engineering and scientific challenge.\\n*   **Algorithm Development:** Creating effective quantum algorithms is a specialized and evolving field.\\n\\n**In summary:** Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computation that leverages the bizarre rules of the quantum world to solve specific types of complex problems far beyond the reach of classical computers. While still facing significant hurdles, it has the potential to reshape entire industries and unlock scientific discoveries that are currently unimaginable.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'} id='lc_run--019b507c-c687-7301-9753-acaaa579dfce-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6, 'output_tokens': 2003, 'total_tokens': 2009, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1106}}\n"

       "[AIMessage(content='Parrots\\' vibrant and diverse feather colors are the result of several evolutionary advantages and biological mechanisms. It\\'s not just one reason, but a combination of factors that make them so striking:\\n\\n1.  **Mate Attraction and Sexual Selection:** This is perhaps the most significant reason.\\n    *   **Signaling Health and Fitness:** Brilliantly colored feathers often indicate a healthy, well-fed individual. Producing and maintaining such vivid plumage requires energy and access to specific nutrients (like carotenoids from their diet). A bird that can maintain bright, perfect feathers is signaling to potential mates that it has good genes, is robust, and capable of finding food – all desirable traits for offspring.\\n    *   **\"Honest Signal\":** These colors act as an \"honest signal\" because they are difficult to fake if the bird is unhealthy or malnourished. Dull, faded, or poorly maintained feathers might signal illness or poor genetic quality.\\n\\n2.  **Species Recognition:** With hundreds of parrot species often coexisting in similar habitats, distinct color patterns help birds recognize members of their own species. This prevents hybridization and ensures successful reproduction within their own kind. Different species can have very similar body shapes but distinct color patches that act as identity markers.\\n\\n3.  **Camouflage (Surprising, but true!):** While they look incredibly conspicuous to us in a zoo, in their natural habitat, these bright colors can actually provide excellent camouflage.\\n    *   **Dappled Light:** In the dense, sun-dappled rainforest canopy, patches of bright green, red, blue, and yellow can blend remarkably well with fruits, flowers, and leaves.\\n    *   **Predator\\'s Perspective:** From a predator\\'s (like a hawk\\'s) viewpoint high above, or a snake\\'s viewpoint close-up, a parrot\\'s broken patterns of color can disrupt its outline, making it harder to spot against the complex background of the forest.\\n\\n4.  **Communication and Social Signaling:** Parrots are highly social birds. Their colors can be used in various social contexts:\\n    *   **Territorial Displays:** Bright colors might be flashed during territorial disputes.\\n    *   **Alarm Signals:** Certain color patterns might be displayed during alarm calls.\\n    *   **Flock Cohesion:** Their visibility within a flock can help maintain group cohesion during flight.\\n\\n5.  **UV Vision (The \"Hidden\" Colors):** Birds, including parrots, see a spectrum of light that extends into ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, which humans cannot see. Many of the colors on their feathers, which might appear plain or merely bright to us, have additional complex UV patterns that are invisible to the human eye. These UV patterns can play a crucial role in mate selection and species recognition.\\n\\n**How the Colors are Made:**\\n\\n*   **Pigments:**\\n    *   **Carotenoids:** These are pigments obtained from their diet (fruits, vegetables, seeds) and produce reds, yellows, and oranges. The more access to carotenoid-rich foods, the brighter these colors can be.\\n    *   **Psittacofulvins:** These are unique pigments found only in parrots, which they synthesize themselves, producing a range of red, orange, and yellow hues.\\n    *   **Melanins:** These pigments produce blacks, browns, and grays.\\n*   **Structural Colors:** Blues and many greens (which are often a combination of structural blue and yellow pigment) are created not by pigment, but by the microscopic structure of the feather barbs. These structures scatter light in a way that makes certain wavelengths visible, producing iridescent or vibrant blues and greens.\\n\\nIn summary, the spectacular coloration of parrots is a sophisticated evolutionary adaptation, serving multiple critical functions that enhance their survival and reproductive success in their complex natural environments.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b507d-25f9-78c3-9a93-69e98a648e33-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 8, 'output_tokens': 1857, 'total_tokens': 1865, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1070}}),\n",
       " AIMessage(content='Airplanes fly due to a fascinating interplay of physics, engineering, and the clever manipulation of air. It all boils down to creating a delicate balance of four fundamental forces: **Lift, Thrust, Drag, and Weight.**\\n\\nLet\\'s break down each force and how they work together:\\n\\n1.  **Lift (The Upward Force):** This is the force that directly opposes the plane\\'s weight and pushes it upwards.\\n    *   **How it\\'s generated:** The wings are designed with a special shape called an **airfoil**. The top surface is curved, and the bottom is relatively flatter.\\n    *   **Bernoulli\\'s Principle:** As the plane moves forward, air flows over and under the wing. The curved top forces the air to travel a slightly longer distance, making it speed up. According to Bernoulli\\'s principle, faster-moving air has lower pressure. The air underneath travels slower, resulting in higher pressure. This difference in pressure (higher pressure below, lower pressure above) creates an upward pushing force – lift!\\n    *   **Newton\\'s Third Law:** The wing is also angled slightly upwards (called the \"angle of attack\"). As the wing pushes air downwards, the air pushes the wing upwards with an equal and opposite reaction, contributing significantly to lift.\\n    *   **Key takeaway:** To generate enough lift, an airplane needs to move forward quickly enough.\\n\\n2.  **Thrust (The Forward Force):** This is the force that propels the airplane forward, counteracting drag.\\n    *   **How it\\'s generated:** Engines provide thrust.\\n        *   **Jet Engines:** Suck in air, compress it, mix it with fuel, ignite it, and blast hot exhaust gases out the back at high speed. According to Newton\\'s Third Law, pushing gas backward creates an equal and opposite force pushing the engine (and thus the plane) forward.\\n        *   **Propeller Engines:** The propeller blades are essentially spinning airfoils. As they spin, they cut through the air and create a pressure difference, pulling air forward and pushing it backward, generating thrust.\\n    *   **Key takeaway:** Thrust gets the plane moving fast enough to generate lift.\\n\\n3.  **Drag (The Resisting Force):** This is the force that opposes the airplane\\'s motion, pulling it backward and slowing it down.\\n    *   **How it\\'s generated:** It\\'s caused by the friction of air against the plane\\'s surfaces and the resistance of the air pushing back as the plane moves through it.\\n    *   **Design for less drag:** Aircraft are designed to be as aerodynamic as possible (smooth shapes, tapered wings, retractable landing gear) to minimize drag and improve fuel efficiency.\\n    *   **Key takeaway:** Thrust must be greater than drag for the plane to accelerate and maintain speed.\\n\\n4.  **Weight (The Downward Force):** This is the force of gravity pulling the airplane downwards.\\n    *   **How it\\'s generated:** It\\'s simply the total mass of the airplane (including fuel, passengers, cargo) being pulled towards the center of the Earth.\\n    *   **Key takeaway:** For an airplane to fly, the lift generated by its wings must be equal to or greater than its total weight.\\n\\n**How They Work Together (The Act of Flying):**\\n\\n*   **Takeoff:** The engines generate maximum **thrust**, accelerating the plane down the runway. As speed increases, the wings generate more and more **lift**. When lift overcomes **weight**, the plane takes off. Thrust must also overcome **drag**.\\n*   **Cruising:** Once at altitude, the pilot reduces thrust. The goal is a steady, level flight where **lift equals weight** and **thrust equals drag**. The plane is in equilibrium.\\n*   **Turning, Climbing, Descending:** The pilot uses control surfaces (ailerons on the wings, elevator on the tail, rudder on the tail) to manipulate lift, drag, and thrust in specific ways to change direction, climb higher (by increasing lift relative to weight), or descend lower (by decreasing lift relative to weight).\\n*   **Landing:** The pilot reduces thrust and uses flaps (devices on the wings that increase lift and drag) and spoilers (which decrease lift and increase drag) to slow the plane down and decrease lift, allowing for a controlled descent and touchdown.\\n\\nIn essence, an airplane flies by using its engines to move forward through the air, and its specially shaped wings to generate an upward force (lift) that overcomes the pull of gravity (weight), all while carefully managing the forces of thrust and drag.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b507d-25fa-75c3-ac08-d472cee66b1b-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6, 'output_tokens': 2152, 'total_tokens': 2158, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1187}}),\n",
